    <h1>I am a full-time student at the <a href=”httpp://uri.edu”>University of Rhode Island</a>, where I am studying to be an Accountant. I work a full-time job in retail currently and have been there for the past fifteen years. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends when I can. My friends and myself love to travel and we take a trip to a different location every year. I have a soon to be three-year-old who also keeps me busy. </h1>
